For the same data set, it is readily seen that the CNN has a better performance than MLP. On the same GPU (Google Colaboratory), MLP and CNN has almost the same time per epoch. Early stopping is done to both and CNN reaches less epochs than MLP with the same criterion. The test accuracy of MLP is around 53% while CNN has a test accuracy of around 72.8%.
